Project Plan: Make a multiplayer rock,paper,scissors game using socket programming in our programming language of choice.
The project will have 2 players who connect to a server, and the server hosts the game of rock,paper,scissors between the two clients.
The clients will choose rock, paper, or scissors and that will be sent to the server, and the server will then compare the results and
determine a winner.

Programming Language: C#

Plan for designing the code
Colin - Client code
Alex - Rock Paper Scisors Logic
